# Module 1: The Planning Problem

## Overview

- This module introduces the richness and challenges of the self-driving motion planning problem, demonstrating a working example that will be built toward throughout this course. 
- The focus will be on defining the primary scenarios encountered in driving, types of loss functions and constraints that affect planning, as well as a common decomposition of the planning problem into behaviour and trajectory planning subproblems. 
- This module introduces a generic, hierarchical motion planning optimization formulation that is further expanded and implemented throughout the subsequent modules.

**Learning Objectives**

- Explain what the autonomous driving high-level mission entails.
- Recall the set of important basic driving scenarios.
- Develop a set of driving behaviours to handle most basic driving scenarios
- Recognize important constraints for autonomous driving motion planning.
- Explain the functionality of each step in a hierarchical motion planner.
- List some variants of each step of a hierarchical motion planner.
