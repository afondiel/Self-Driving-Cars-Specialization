# Course-4 - W6 - MODULE 6: Reactive Planning in Static Environments

## Overview

- A reactive planner takes local information available within a sensor footprint and a global objective defined in a map coordinate frame to identify a locally feasible path to follow that is collision free and makes progress to a goal. 
- In this module, learners will develop a trajectory rollout and dynamic window planner, which enables path finding in arbitrary static 2D environments. 
- The limits of the approach for true self-driving will also be discussed.

**Learning Objectives**

- Given a kinematic model for a robot, calculate trajectories based on control inputs.
- Understand how to apply swath-based and circle-based collision checking.
- Implement the trajectory rollout algorithm.
- Understand the tradeoffs and advantages of applying dynamic windowing to the trajectory - rollout algorithm.
