# Course-2 - W5 - MODULE 5 : Putting It together - An Autonomous Vehicle State Estimator

## Overview 
- This module combines materials from Modules 1-4 together, with the goal of developing a full vehicle state estimator. 
- Learners will build, using data from the CARLA simulator, an error-state extended Kalman filter-based estimator that incorporates GPS, IMU, and LIDAR measurements to determine the vehicle position and orientation on the road at a high update rate. 
- There will be an opportunity to observe what happens to the quality of the state estimate when one or more of the sensors either 'drop out' or are disabled.

**Course Objectives :**
- Apply filtering-based state estimation to determine the pose of a vehicle on the roadway
- Use LIDAR scan registration (to an existing map) to improve state estimates
- Test the effects of the loss of one or more sensors on the vehicle pose estimate
