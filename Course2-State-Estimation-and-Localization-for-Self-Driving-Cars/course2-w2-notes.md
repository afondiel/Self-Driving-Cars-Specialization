# Course-2 - W2 - MODULE 2 : State Estimation - Linear and Nonlinear Kalman Filters

## Overview 
- Any engineer working on autonomous vehicles must understand the Kalman filter, first described in a paper by Rudolf Kalman in 1960. 
- The filter has been recognized as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century, is implemented in software that runs on your smartphone and on modern jet aircraft, and was crucial to enabling the Apollo spacecraft to reach the moon. 
- This module derives the Kalman filter equations from a least squares perspective, for linear systems. The module also examines why the Kalman filter is the best linear unbiased estimator (that is, it is optimal in the linear case). 
- The Kalman filter, as originally published, is a linear algorithm; however, all systems in practice are nonlinear to some degree. Shortly after the Kalman filter was developed, it was extended to nonlinear systems, resulting in an algorithm now called the ‚Äòextended‚Äô Kalman filter, or EKF. 
- The EKF is the ‚Äòbread and butter‚Äô of state estimators, and should be in every engineer‚Äôs toolbox. 
- This module explains how the EKF operates (i.e., through linearization) and discusses its relationship to the original Kalman filter. 
- The module also provides an overview of the unscented Kalman filter, or UKF, a more recently developed and very popular member of the Kalman filter family.


**Course Objectives :**
- Describe the relationship between least squares and the linear Kalman filter
- Explain the (in)sensitivity of the Kalman filter to new data and the need for process noise
- Describe how the linear Kalman filter can be extended to nonlinear systems via linearization
- Describe how the EKF uses first-order linearization to turn a nonlinear problem into a linear one
- Contrast the linearization approach of the EKF with that of the UKF, and explain why the UKF is superior for many problems
- Assess the performance of the extended Kalman filter and its variants


## The Linear Kalman Filter (LKF)

- The Kalman filter remains an important tool to fuse measurements from **several sensors** to **estimate in real-time the state** of a robotic system such as a self-driving car

### Lesson 1: The (Linear) Kalman Filter

- The Kalman filter algorithm was published in `1960` by Rudolf E. Kalman
- Adopted by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) earlier after its publication for the Apollo Guidance Computer to sent Man into space

<img src="./resources/w2/apollo-guidance-computer.png" width="240" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- The filter helped guided spacecraft accurately throught its **circumlunar orbit**

<img src="./resources/w2/extend-KF.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- The (extended) Kalman Filter became widely known after its use in the
Apollo Guidance Computer for circumlunar navigation.

**Prediction and Correction**
- Very similar to the linear Recursive Least Squares (RLS) Filter 
- While RLS updates the estimate of a static parameter, 
- `KF updates and estimates of an evolving state` 
- The `Goal` of KF: take a probabilistic estimate of this state and update it in real time using two steps : 
- 1. **Prediction**
- 2. **Correction**

Study Case : problem of estimating the 1D position of the vehicle

<img src="./resources/w2/TKF-prediction.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- This can be broken down into 3 steps : 
1. Initial probabilistic Estimate at time $k-1$
2. Use **Motion Model** (which can be derived from Wheel odometry or Inertial sensor measurement)to predict our new state
3. Use **Obesrvation Model** (derived from GPS, LIDAR) to correct that prediction at time $k$ to find the final state
- Notice : All the states (initial, predicted and final) are all random variables specify by their means and covariances

``` 
- KF can seen as a technique/tool to fuse informations from several sensors to produce a final estimate the unkown state in real-time, taking into account uncertainty in motion and in our measurements
```

**Linear Dynamical System**

- The Kalman Filter requires the following motion and measurement models:

<img src="./resources/w2/motion-model.png" width="200" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Motion model** : linear combination btw the estimate at time step $k-1$, control input and zero-mean noise

$$
\displaystyle x_{k} = 
F_{k‚àí1}x_{k‚àí1} + G_{k‚àí1}u{k‚àí1} + w{k‚àí1}
$$

where :
- $F_{k‚àí1}, G_{k‚àí1}$ , the gain ?  
- $u_{k‚àí1}$, is the input signal/control input (can be a wheel torque applied to speed up & change lanes )
- $w_{k‚àí1}$, is zero-mean noise

**Measurement model**: 

$$
\displaystyle y{k} = 
H_{k}x{k} + v_{k}
$$

where :

- $v_{k}$, is the measurement noise
  
**With the following noise properties:**
  
- Measurement Noise : 

$$
vk ‚àº ùí©(0,R_{k})
$$

- Process or Motion Noise : govern how certain we are that our linear dynamical system is actually correct/ how uncertain we are about the effects of our control inputs

$$
w{k} ‚àº ùí©(0,Q_{k})
$$

**Recursive Least Squares + Process Model**

- The Kalman filter is a recursive least squares estimator that also includes a motion model

- `1.` Prediction

$$
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \check{x}_{k} = 
F_{k‚àí1}x_{k‚àí1} + G_{k‚àí1}u_{k‚àí1} \\
\displaystyle \check{P}_{k} = 
F_{k‚àí1} \check{P}_{k‚àí1}F_{k‚àí1}^T + Q_{k‚àí1}
\end{cases}
$$


- `2a.` Optimal Gain

$$
\displaystyle K_{k} = 
\check{P}_{k}H_{k}^T(H_{k} \check{P}_{k}H_{k}^T + R_{k})^‚àí1
$$

- `2b.` Correction

$$
\begin{cases}

\displaystyle \hat{x}_{k} = 
\check{x}_{k} + K_{k}(y_{k} ‚àí H_{k}\check{x}_{k}) \\
\displaystyle \hat{P}_{k} = 
(1 ‚àí K_{k}H_{k})\check{P}_{k}
\end{cases}
$$

where : 
- $(y_{k} ‚àí H_{k}\check{x}_{k})$, is often called the `innovation`
- $\check{x}_{k}$, Prediction (given motion model) at time $k$
- $\hat{x}_{k}$, Corrected prediction (given measurement) at time $k$

**Recap : Prediction & Correction**

**Short example**

<img src="./resources/w2/ex.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

Where : 
- PDF : Probability Density Function 
- $a$ : is a constant acceleration from dynamic controller
- we assume, the vehicle position is measured by a GPS 


<img src="./resources/w2/ex2.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

What's our corrected position estimate after we perform one prediction step and one correction step using KF? 

**Solution:**

- Prediction 

<img src="./resources/w2/ex3.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- Correction 

<img src="./resources/w2/ex4.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

Result analysis : 
- The final corrected state **covariance is smaller**
- More certain about the car's position after we incorporate the position measurement
- Measurement noise variance is quite small

**Summary | The Kalman Filter**

- The Kalman Filter is very similar to RLS but includes a motion model that tells
us how the state evolves over time
- The Kalman Filter updates a state estimate through two stages:
  1. prediction using the **motion model**
  2. correction using the **measurement model**

### Lesson 2: Kalman Filter and The Bias BLUEs

**Bias in State Estimation**

<img src="./resources/w2/l2-bias.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- We say an estimator or filter is unbiased if it produces an `average` error of zero at a particular time step $k$, over many trials.
- Graphically : 

<img src="./resources/w2/l2-bias2.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">
 
- We build a histogram of the positions that our filter reports over multiple trials
- We compute the difference btw the avg of these estimates and the true position.
- If the difference doesnot approach zero, the estimate is `biased`
- Otherwise, the filter is `unbiased`

$$
\displaystyle E[\hat{e}_{k}] = 
E[\hat{p}_{k} - p_{k}] = E[\hat{p}_{k}] - p_{k} = 0
$$

How can we compute this analytically for the Kalman filter?
- consider the error dynamics : 
  - Predicted state error : 

$$\displaystyle \check{e}_{k} = 
\check{x}_{k} + x_{k}
$$
  - Corrected estimate error : 
  
$$\displaystyle \hat{e}_{k} = 
\hat{x}_{k} + x_{k}
$$   

- Using the KF equations, we can derive : 

- PE : 

$$\displaystyle \check{e}_{k} = 
F_{k-1}\check{x}_{k-1} + w_{k}
$$

- CE :

$$\displaystyle \hat{e}_{k} = 
(1-K_{k}H_{k})\check{x}_{k} + K_{k}v_{k}
$$   

For the KF, for all $k$,

<img src="./resources/w2/l2-bias3.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Note** : this does not mean that the error on a given trial will be zero, but that, with enough trials, our expected error is zero!

**Consistency in State Estimation**

- By concistency we mean that for all time steps $k$, the filter covariance $\hat{p}_{k}$ matches the espected value of the square of our error.
- for scalar parameters, this means that the empirical variance of the estimate should match the variance reported by the filter
  - The filter is consistent if for all $k$,
  
$$
\displaystyle E[\hat{e}_{k}^2] = 
E[(\hat{p}_{k} - p_{k})^2] = \hat{P}_{k}
$$

- In practice, this means that our filter is neither *overconfident*, nor *underconfident* in the estimate it has producted
- A *overconfident* filter and inconcistent will report a covariance that is optimistic
- The filter will place too much emphasis on its own estimate and will be less sensitive to future measurement updates which may be `critical`
- This may cause negative or dangerous effect on the performance self-driving cars 

<img src="./resources/w2/l2-bias4.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**The Kalman Filter is the BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator)**

- We're shown that given our linear formulation, and zero-mean, white noise the KF is **unbiased**
- We can also say that the filter is **consistent**


  - $E[\hat{e}_{k}] = 0$


  - $E[\hat{e}_{k} \hat{e}_{k}^T] = \hat{P}_{k}$


- In general, if we have white, uncorrelated zero-mean noise, the Kalman filter is the best (i.e.., lowest variance) unbiased estimator that uses only a linear combination of measurements
- For this reason, we call it the `BLUE`

**Summary**

The KF is : 
- unbiased
- consistent
- the lowest variance estimator that uses a linear combination of measurements: Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (**BLUE**)
- Limitations : 
  - self-driving generally uses nonlinear quantities : vehicle poses, position and orientation in 2D and 3D

## The Nonlinear Kalman Filter
<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- Design to work w/ non linear systems, also considered as workhorses of state estimation because of its multiple applicatioins
  
### Lesson 3: Going Nonlinear - The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

- Choose an operation point $a$ and approximate the nonlinear function by a tangent line at point

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF2.png" width="300" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- Mathematically, we compute this linear approximation using a first-order Taylor expansion:

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF3.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- For the EKF, we choose the **operating point** to be our most recent state estimate, our known input and zero noise: 

- Linearized motion model : 

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF31.png" width="700" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

-  Linearized measurement model : 

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF32.png" width="700" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- We now have a linear system in state-space! The matrices $F_{k-1}$ , $L_{k-1}$ , $H_{k}$ , and $M_{k}$ , are called the `Jacobian` matrices of the system.

**Computing Jacobian Matrices**

In vector calculus, a Jacobian matrix is the matrix of the all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-values function 

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF5.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

Intuitively, the Jacobian matric tells you how fast each output of the function is changing along each input dimension

- For example : 

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF6.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Putting it all together**

With our **linearized models** and **Jacobians**, we can now use KF equations : 

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF7.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- We still using the nonlinear models to propagate the mean of the estimate and to compute the residual & innovation
  - after linearization of our previous state estimate of the motion  models, and measurement model about the predicted estate
- The nonlinear model always concises with linear model at the operating point
- The second difference is the matrice $L$ & $M$ => process and measurement noise
- $L$ & $M$ are in general **identity matrix** since noise is assumed to be additive (offset), but it's not always the case

**Short Example**
```
Tracking the position and velocity of the car moving along the rail, instead of receiving periodic GPS measuremens that tells us our position, we use on-board sensor like *camera* to measure the altitude distant landmarks relative to the horizon
```
- Assumptions :
  -  we know, both the **height** of landmarks (Rep√®res) and its **position** in a global reference frame


<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF8.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- Because our sensor is measured angle ( $\phi$ ), the measurement model has a nonlinear dependence on the position of the car (motion model)
  - S/(D - pk) : Non-linearity expression!!!
  - (D - pk) shall be different to `zero`
- Measurement model needs to be linearized
- Motion model Jacobian is always linear in state

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF9.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- Data : 

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF10.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Solution**

- Prediction
  
<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF11.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">


- Correction

<img src="./resources/w2/l3-EKF12.png" width="600" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Results analysis**
- The prediction result is the same as the LKF example (lesson1)
- The correction result, the corrected covariance doesnot change much compared to LKF because of angle change slowly with the distance doesnot provide too much info about the vehicle state compared to GPS measurement
- [Implementation code here](./resources/w2/lab/Extend_Kalman_filter_EKF.ipynb)


**Summary**
- The EKF uses *linearization* to adapt the KF to nonlinear systems
- Linearization works by computing a local linear approximation to a nonlinear function about a chosen operating point
- Linearization relies on computing *Jacobian matrices*, which contain all the **first-order** partial deritatives of a function
