# Course-2 - W2 - MODULE 2 : State Estimation - Linear and Nonlinear Kalman Filters

## Overview 
- Any engineer working on autonomous vehicles must understand the Kalman filter, first described in a paper by Rudolf Kalman in 1960. 
- The filter has been recognized as one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century, is implemented in software that runs on your smartphone and on modern jet aircraft, and was crucial to enabling the Apollo spacecraft to reach the moon. 
- This module derives the Kalman filter equations from a least squares perspective, for linear systems. The module also examines why the Kalman filter is the best linear unbiased estimator (that is, it is optimal in the linear case). 
- The Kalman filter, as originally published, is a linear algorithm; however, all systems in practice are nonlinear to some degree. Shortly after the Kalman filter was developed, it was extended to nonlinear systems, resulting in an algorithm now called the ‚Äòextended‚Äô Kalman filter, or EKF. 
- The EKF is the ‚Äòbread and butter‚Äô of state estimators, and should be in every engineer‚Äôs toolbox. 
- This module explains how the EKF operates (i.e., through linearization) and discusses its relationship to the original Kalman filter. 
- The module also provides an overview of the unscented Kalman filter, or UKF, a more recently developed and very popular member of the Kalman filter family.


**Course Objectives :**
- Describe the relationship between least squares and the linear Kalman filter
- Explain the (in)sensitivity of the Kalman filter to new data and the need for process noise
- Describe how the linear Kalman filter can be extended to nonlinear systems via linearization
- Describe how the EKF uses first-order linearization to turn a nonlinear problem into a linear one
- Contrast the linearization approach of the EKF with that of the UKF, and explain why the UKF is superior for many problems
- Assess the performance of the extended Kalman filter and its variants


## The Linear Kalman Filter

- The Kalman filter remains an important tool to fuse measurements from **several sensors** to **estimate in real-time the state** of a robotic system such as a self-driving car

### Lesson 1: The (Linear) Kalman Filter

- The Kalman filter algorithm was published in `1960` by Rudolf E. Kalman
- Adopted by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) earlier after its publication for the Apollo Guidance Computer to sent Man into space

- The filter helped guided spacecraft accurately throught its **circumlunar orbit**

<img src="./resources/w2/extend-KF.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- The (extended) Kalman Filter became widely known after its use in the
Apollo Guidance Computer for circumlunar navigation.

**Prediction and Correction**
- Very similar to the linear Recursive Least Squares (RLS) Filter 
- While RLS updates the estimate of a static parameter, 
- `KF updates and estimates of an evolving state` 
- The `Goal` of KF: take a probabilistic estimate of this state and update it in real time using two steps : 
- 1. **Prediction**
- 2. **Correction**

Study Case : problem of estimating the 1D position of the vehicle

<img src="./resources/w2/TKF-prediction.png" width="500" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- This can be broken down into 3 steps : 
1. Initial probabilistic Estimate at time $k-1$
2. Use **Motion Model** (which can be derived from Wheel odometry or Inertial sensor measurement)to predict our new state
3. Use **Obesrvation Model** (derived from GPS, LIDAR) to correct that prediction at time $k$ to find the final state
- Notice : All the states (initial, predicted and final) are all random variables specify by their means and covariances

``` 
- KF can seen as a technique/tool to fuse informations from several sensors to produce a final estimate the unkown state in real-time, taking into account uncertainty in motion and in our measurements
```

**Linear Dynamical System**

- The Kalman Filter requires the following motion and measurement models:

<img src="./resources/w2/motion-model.png" width="200" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Motion model** : linear combination btw the estimate at time step $k-1$, control input and zero-mean noise

$$
\displaystyle x_{k} = 
F_{k‚àí1}x_{k‚àí1} + G_{k‚àí1}u{k‚àí1} + w{k‚àí1}
$$

where :
- $F_{k‚àí1}, G_{k‚àí1}$ , the gain ?  
- $u_{k‚àí1}$, is the input signal/control input (can be a wheel torque applied to speed up & change lanes )
- $w_{k‚àí1}$, is zero-mean noise

**Measurement model**: 

$$
\displaystyle y{k} = 
H_{k}x{k} + v_{k}
$$

where :

- $v_{k}$, is the measurement noise
  
**With the following noise properties:**
  
- Measurement Noise : 

$$
vk ‚àº ùí©(0,R_{k})
$$

- Process or Motion Noise : govern how certain we are that our linear dynamical system is actually correct/ how uncertain we are about the effects of our control inputs

$$
w{k} ‚àº ùí©(0,Q_{k})
$$

**Recursive Least Squares + Process Model**

- The Kalman filter is a recursive least squares estimator that also includes a motion model

- `1.` Prediction

$$
\displaystyle \check{x}_{k} = 
F_{k‚àí1}x_{k‚àí1} + G_{k‚àí1}u_{k‚àí1}
$$

,

$$
\displaystyle \check{P}_{k} = 
F_{k‚àí1} \check{P}_{k‚àí1}F_{k‚àí1}^T + Q_{k‚àí1}
$$

- `2a.` Optimal Gain


$$
\displaystyle K_{k} = 
\check{P}_{k}H_{k}^T(H_{k} \check{P}_{k}H_{k}^T + R_{k})^‚àí1
$$

- `2b.` Correction

$$
\displaystyle \hat{x}_{k} = 
\check{x}_{k} + K_{k}(y_{k} ‚àí H_{k}\check{x}_{k})
$$

,

$$
\displaystyle \hat{P}_{k} = 
(1 ‚àí K_{k}H_{k})\check{P}_{k}
$$

where : 
- $(y_{k} ‚àí H_{k}\check{x}_{k})$, is often called the `innovation`
- $\check{x}_{k}$, Prediction (given motion model) at time $k$
- $\hat{x}_{k}$, Corrected prediction (given measurement) at time $k$

**Process Recap : Prediction & Correction**

**Short example**

<img src="./resources/w2/ex.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

Where : 
- $a$ : is a constant acceleration from dynamic controller
- we assume, the vehicle position is measured by a GPS 


<img src="./resources/w2/ex2.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

What's our corrected position estimate after we perform one prediction step and one correction step using KF? 

**Solution:**

- Prediction 

<img src="./resources/w2/ex3.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

- Correction 

<img src="./resources/w2/ex4.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

Result analysis : 
- The final corrected state **covariance is smaller**
- More certain about the car's position after we incorporate the position measurement
- Measurement noise variance is quite small


**Summary | The Kalman Filter**

- The Kalman Filter is very similar to RLS but includes a motion model that tells
us how the state evolves over time
- The Kalman Filter updates a state estimate through two stages:
  1. prediction using the **motion model**
  2. correction using the **measurement model**
