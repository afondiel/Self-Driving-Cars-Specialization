- Learn about sensors for state estimation & localization
- `state estimation` is the process of determining the best value of some physical quantity from what are typically **noisy measurements**
- measurements are noisy because sensors are not perfect (random results for the same input signal)
- state estimation is fundamental to any device with sensor  
- Localization is one the most important types of state estimation for self-driving cars
- `Localization:` is the process of determining `where` the car is in world and `how` is moving

**Course overview**

- Understand the method of least squares for parameter and state estimation
- Apply the linear Kalman filter and its nonlinear variants, the extended and unscented Kalman filters, to state estimation problems
- Develop models for typical localization sensors like GPS receivers, inertial sensors, and LIDAR range sensors
- Learn about LIDAR scan matching and the iterate closest point (ICP) algorithm
- Use these tools to fuse data from multiple sensors streams into a single state estimate for self-driving car
- `Final Project:` A full vehicle state estimator for self-driving cars using the CARLA simulator.

### The Importance of State Estimation
- Why is state estimation so critical for self-drving cars ? 
  - you need to know where you are
  - all you get as input is sensor data 
  - the state is an answer to where the car is, how it is moving, how fast it is turning
  - state estimation allows to process sensor data at highest level
  - state estimation is a challenging problem to solve because the sensor datas are often foul and noisy 
# Module 1: Least Squares

## Overview 

- The method of least squares, developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1795, is a well known technique for estimating parameter values from data. 
- This module provides a review of least squares, for the cases of unweighted and weighted observations. 
- There is a deep connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (when the observations are considered to be Gaussian random variables) and this  connection is established and explained. 
- Finally, the module develops a technique to transform the traditional 'batch' least squares estimator to a recursive form,  suitable for online, real-time estimation applications.

**Course Objectives:**

- Understand the squared error optimization criterion and its use
- Explain how least squares is employed in parameter estimation problems
- Apply the unweighted and weighted least squares methods to parameter estimation
- Apply a recursive version of least squares to update parameter estimates as new measurements arrive
- Explain how Jacobian matrices are used

### Lesson 1 (Part 1): Squared Error Criterion and the Method of Least Squares

- `Localization:` is the process of determining `where` the car is in world and `how` is moving
- `state estimation` is the process of determining the best value of some physical quantity from what are typically **noisy measurements**

- An accurate localization is a key component of any self-driving car sw stack and state estimation is the way of doing so.
- Any real world measurements will be imprecise
- State estimation is the idea of parameter estimation
  - `state:` physical quantity that changes overtime (ex: position and orientation)
  - `parameter:` is constant over time  (ex: electric resistor)

**Least Squares**

- Develped by Carl F. Gauss (1809)
- Theorem : 

```
The most probable value of the unknown quantities will be that in which the sum of squares of the differences btw the actually observed and the computed values multiplied by numbers that measure the degree of precision is minimum. 
```
**Illustraction examples : Estimating Resistance**
- Measurement model : 
  - $\displaystyle y_{i} = x + \nu_{i}$
- where :
  - $y$ : measurements  
  - $i$ : the number of experiments/ independent measurements
  - $x$ : Actual resistance (constant)
  - $\nu$ : Measurement noise 
  
- after 4 measurements :

**Minimizing the Squared Error Criterion (SEC)**

$$
\displaystyle \hat{x}_{LS} = 
argmin_{x}(e_{1}^2 + e_{2}^2 +e_{3}^2 +e_{4}^2) = 
J_{LS}(x)
$$

- To minimize the SEC, we rewrite the errors in matrix notation 
- Useful when dealing with thousands/larges numbers of measurements 

<img src="./resources/w1/matrix-error.png" width="360" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

where : 
- $e$ : is the error vector
- $y$ : the measurements/function of observations
- $H$ : the Jacobian matrix 
  - $dim(H) = m x n$ , $m$ : numbers of measurements, $n$ : nb of unkown/parameters to be estimated
- $x$ : the resistance (a single scalar but can also be a vector) 

We can now express our criterion as follows

$$
\displaystyle J_{LS}(x) =
e^Te = (y - Hx)^T(y - Hx) = y^Ty - x^TH^Ty - y^THx + x^TH^THx
$$

- To minimize this, we can compute `the partial derivative` with respect to our parameter, set to `zero`, and solve for extremum:

> We will only be able to solve for $\hat{x}$ if ($H^TH$)^-1 exits, i.e : $H$ has an inverse

<img src="./resources/w1/problem-solution.png" width="400" style="border:0px solid #FFFFFF; padding:1px; margin:1px">

**Assumptions**

- Our measurement model, $y = x + \nu$ , is linear
- Measurements are **equally weighted** (we do not suspect that some have more noise than others)
