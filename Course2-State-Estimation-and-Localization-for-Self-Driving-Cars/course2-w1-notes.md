- Learn about sensors for state estimation & localization
- `state estimation` is the process of determining the best value of some physical quantity from what are typically **noisy measurements**
- measurements are noisy because sensors are not perfect (random results for the same input signal)
- state estimation is fundamental to any device with sensor  
- Localization is one the most important types of state estimation for self-driving cars
- `Localization:` is the process of determining `where` the car is in world and `how` is moving

**Course overview**

- Understand the method of least squares for parameter and state estimation
- Apply the linear Kalman filter and its nonlinear variants, the extended and unscented Kalman filters, to state estimation problems
- Develop models for typical localization sensors like GPS receivers, inertial sensors, and LIDAR range sensors
- Learn about LIDAR scan matching and the iterate closest point (ICP) algorithm
- Use these tools to fuse data from multiple sensors streams into a single state estimate for self-driving car
- `Final Project:` A full vehicle state estimator for self-driving cars using the CARLA simulator.

### The Importance of State Estimation
- Why is state estimation so critical for self-drving cars ? 
  - you need to know where you are
  - all you get as input is sensor data 
  - the state is an answer to where the car is, how it is moving, how fast it is turning
  - state estimation allows to process sensor data at highest level
  - state estimation is a challenging problem to solve because the sensor datas are often foul and noisy 
# Module 1: Least Squares

## Overview 

- The method of least squares, developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1795, is a well known technique for estimating parameter values from data. 
- This module provides a review of least squares, for the cases of unweighted and weighted observations. 
- There is a deep connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (when the observations are considered to be Gaussian random variables) and this  connection is established and explained. Finally, the module develops a technique to transform the traditional 'batch' least squares estimator to a recursive form,  suitable for online, real-time estimation applications.

**Course Objectives:**

- Understand the squared error optimization criterion and its use
- Explain how least squares is employed in parameter estimation problems
- Apply the unweighted and weighted least squares methods to parameter estimation
- Apply a recursive version of least squares to update parameter estimates as new measurements arrive
- Explain how Jacobian matrices are used
