### The Importance of State Estimation

# Module 1: Least Squares

## Overview 

- The method of least squares, developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1795, is a well known technique for estimating parameter values from data. 
- This module provides a review of least squares, for the cases of unweighted and weighted observations. 
- There is a deep connection between least squares and maximum likelihood estimators (when the observations are considered to be Gaussian random variables) and this  connection is established and explained. Finally, the module develops a technique to transform the traditional 'batch' least squares estimator to a recursive form,  suitable for online, real-time estimation applications.

**Course Objectives:**

- Understand the squared error optimization criterion and its use
- Explain how least squares is employed in parameter estimation problems
- Apply the unweighted and weighted least squares methods to parameter estimation
- Apply a recursive version of least squares to update parameter estimates as new measurements arrive
- Explain how Jacobian matrices are used
