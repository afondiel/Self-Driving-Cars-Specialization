# Course-2 - W3 - MODULE 3 : GNSS/INS Sensing for Pose Estimation

## Overview 

- To navigate reliably, autonomous vehicles require an estimate of their pose (position and orientation) in the world (and on the road) at all times.
- Much like for modern aircraft, this information can be derived from a combination of GPS measurements and inertial navigation system (INS) data.
- This module introduces sensor models for inertial measurement units and GPS (and, more broadly, GNSS) receivers; performance and noise characteristics are reviewed.
- The module describes ways in which the two sensor systems can be used in combination to provide accurate and robust vehicle pose estimates.

**Course Objectives :**

- Explain the operation of the two most common sensors used for pose estimation in autonomous driving, inertial meaurement units and GNSS receivers.
- Understand the concept of coordinate acceleration and the fundamental equation of inertial navigation.
- Apply gyroscope and accelerometer measurement models in the context of navigation.
- Describe the process of trilateration and justify why four satellites must be visible to obtain a 3D position fix from a GPS (GNSS) receiver.
- Understand why ionospheric delays and multipath effects can degrade the performance of GPS.
