# Course 1 - W4 - MODULE 4: Vehicle Longitudinal Control

## Overview 

- Longitudinal control of an autonomous vehicle involves tracking a speed profile along a fixed path, and can be achieved with reasonable accuracy using classic control techniques. 
- This week, you will learn how to develop a baseline controller that is applicable for a significant subset of driving conditions, which include most non-evasive or highly-dynamic motions.

**Learning Objectives**
- Design a PID controller for a linear system
- Decompose a coupled nonlinear vehicle model and extract a linear decoupled longitudinal model
- Develop a feedforward controller for longitudinal vehicle control
