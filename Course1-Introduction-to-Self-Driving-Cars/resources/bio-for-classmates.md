My name is Afonso Diela, from Paris, France. Currently, Software Engineer working in the Automotive Industry for about 7 years. 

Passionate about automotive, motorsport, and AI. I believe Self-driving cars are the next revolution in the automotive industry and will help increase road safety and save many lives. 

That's why I'm so excited to take this course because I want to help shape the future.

Cheers!
