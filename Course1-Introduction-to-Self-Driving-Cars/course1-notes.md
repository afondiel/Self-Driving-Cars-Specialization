  - Examine the state of the self-driving industry


### Introduction to Self-Driving Cars
---
- **Welcome to the Self-Driving Cars Specialization**


Instructors : `Steve Waslander` and `Jonathan Kelly` both Associate professor in Aerospace studies at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

`Self-driving cars` is a sleeping geant which can change everything
  - road safety
  - mobility for everyone
  - reduce the cost of driving 
  - Steve and Jonathan built a self-driving car for research porpose :
    `Autonomoose`
Global overview and requirements for each of four courses which are already described in the introduction section of each course.

Autonomous driving is a constantly and changing field : 
- Self-driving
- Robotics
- AI and ML

- **Welcome to the Course**

By the end of this course : 
- Learn about the elements of drving : perception, prediction, decision making
- Understand how to design the software(sw) and hardware(hw) stack to do autonomous driving 
- Understand common safety pratices for autonomous driving
- Learn the basics of vehicle modeling and control, and controllers to do speed regulation, path following(finding)
- State of the art of the model predictive trajectory controllers for precisely executing challenging maneuvers
- Use these concepts to help navigate a self driving car in CARLA(test the limits of the vehicles performances...)

- **The Story of Autonomous Vehicles**
  
  - More than 94% of road accidents are caused by some kind of human error
  - The Ambition/dream/motivation behind the self-driving cars technology is to minimize or reduce human errors and deaths `out of the picture` through the **automation**. 
  - Other advantages : 
    - replace the driving tasks/controls and focus on the eat, relax. Make the morning more productive : send emails for instance.
  
- `1925` : Francis Udina(A Mechanic Engineer) demostrated a remote control car `The American Wonder` drove in the street of Manhattan with an empty drivers seat
- `1956` : GM promoted a campaign of self-driving car to be arrived by 1976

## MODULE-1 : The requirements for Autonomy 

Self-driving cars present an extremely rich and inter-disciplinary problem. This module introduces the language and structure of the problem definition, defining the most salient elements of the driving task and the driving environment.

> Learning Objectives : 
> - Identify perception, prediction and planning requirements for driving
> - Define the environmental elements that influence driving
> - Breakdown the task of driving into elemental decisions and actions
> - Assess the effects of driving conditions on the driving task
